# Mini Project #4: Ruby on Rails with React

## Overview

You will build a Rails & React App for one more repetition to solidify this unit and prepare you for your final project.

Keep the scope of this small and polish it well! You'll only have a week to work on it, and you may be busy with Outcomes and job search work.

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* **Rails backend**: Serve a JSON API with all CRUD operations available across your models. The Rails API must be deployed online via Heroku.
	* Must have at least one model with full CRUD
* **React frontend**: Serve a React frontend that consumes your Rails API. The React frontend must be deployed online via Heroku or (more likely) GitHub Pages.
* **Two git repositories** hosted on Github, with a link to the relevant live sites, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often!
* At **least** one Github commit per day.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc. As well as a **link to your hosted working app**

---

### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features - choose two or more

* Configure CORS in your rails API so that **only** your frontend app can access your API
* Use Sass
* Include **two or more models** (additional models do not require full CRUD)
* Include either a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship (full CRUD not required)
* Use a **third party API** with a gem
* Add **graphs or visuals** on your data with `Chart.js` or `D3.js`
* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo)
* **Authentication**
* **Implement React Router**

## Meetings with instructors

_We will do quick approval meetings in the first half of class on Wednesday, August 7th_

## How to Submit Your Project
Your project is due on Wednesday, August 14th at 8:00 pm EST (1.5 hours after class starts).

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* Create your **user stories**

<br>

* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given a week so that you can work on it in small chunks, so COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
