# Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create a 5-minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developers. Please create a Google Slides presentation outlining your findings during your research. It should address the following:

- What problem does this technology solve?
- How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
- What did you build with this technology? (demo)

We will present on these topics at ~630pm MT on Tuesday, August 6th.

Generally, when learning a new technology, it is important to maximize usefulness while minimizing difficulty. Consider making a sorted "hit-list" with these two factors in mind.

>It is advised to pick something that will be relevant to project 4 or project 5 if you have a clear idea of something you want to build that is out of the scope of material we learned. It is also advised to pick something that lines up with job descriptions you are interested in.
