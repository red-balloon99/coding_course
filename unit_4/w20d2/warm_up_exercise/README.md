# Ruby Exercises

Now that we are knee-deep in Rails, let's take a step back to shore up our Ruby skills.

There are several ways you can take this "cool down" activity, but whichever one you choose should involve Ruby in some way.

## Option 1: The Easy Way Out

Head to CodeWars(https://www.codewars.com) and finish a couple level 8 or 7 kata with Ruby, **not** JavaScript.

## Option 2: The Hard Way Out

[We](../../w19d1/warm_up_exercise) have [done](../../../unit_3/w16d1/warm_up_exercise) a [lot](../../../unit_3/w15d2/warm_up_exercise) of [exercises](../../../unit_3/w14d2/warm_up_exercise) in JavaScript.  Redo one or two of them with Ruby.

## Option 3: When Is Project 4?

Project 4 will be a full-stack project, built with Ruby on Rails for the back end and React for the front end.

What do you want to build for Project 4?  Make a couple wireframes, and define the models and routes you would need.  Do you need a 3rd Party API or two?  Do you want to study a new technology?  What are they?

## Hungry for More?

Go back and finish the last of the Ruby exercises from the earlier [warm up activity](../../w19d2/warm_up_exercise).
