### What is Rails?

[Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails).

#### Rails Features:

- Open Source - free to use, anyone can contribute
- Vast collection of open source code available within Rails community
- MVC framework (Model View Controller)
- RESTful application design
<!-- - Built-in server-side rendering with .erb (**E**mbedded **R**u**B**y) -->
- Built-in ORM (Object Relational Mapping - programming technique for converting
   data between incompatible type systems using OOP.
   - Example: converting data that is in rows/columns/tables into JSON)
   - Called Active Record, based on [Active Record Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern) **
- Encourages Agile web development
- Strong focus on testing, and utilizing testing for documentation

Rails is a server environment just like Node. The big difference is that Rails favors **convention** over **configuration**.

Rails can get things up and running quickly and effectively -- as long as you do it _exactly the way Rails tell you to_. For example:

* Rails wants you to name your models and controllers a certain way, otherwise it won't work.
* Rails requires you to run a small program called a migration in order to change any database fields.

Node, by comparison is a blank slate where all things are possible. The tradeoff, with Rails, is ease-of-use for large-scale applications. Whether this is a straightjacket or a wonderful gift is up to you as a developer.

<br>
<hr>

#### Rails Philosophies:

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Convention over Configuration

We've seen a lot of similar things in our previous units. That's because the emergence of Rails and its popularity influenced web development as a whole, and many new frameworks continue to use many of the successful patterns and features that Rails developed.

Something we _haven't_ seen yet is a new philosophy called `Convention over Configuration`.

- Express is a minimalist framework, where you add in each piece of functionality that you need. Therefore you must also configure everything. There are some recommended patterns, but you can really build the app any way you want.
- Rails provides you with tons of functionality. However, in order to utilize this right-out-of-the-box functionality you must follow all of the Rails conventions.
  - This means proper pluralization and capitalization will make or break your app (literally)

#### Express vs. Rails in our course

| Comparison |Express| Rails |Comments |
|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
|Language|JavaScript| Ruby | Still need JS on the front end|
|Database| MongoDB| Postgres |MongoDB is considered NoSQL, while Postgres is SQL|
|ODM/ORM| Mongoose| Active Record |Active Record will convert our SQL into JSON|
|Third Party Code|NPM| Gem/ bundler/ bundler install|Gems are installed globally by default, npm packages are installed locally by default|
|server-side rendering|EJS or Handlebars| ~~[erb](https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/)~~|We'll be skipping right into rendering our views with React|
|run the server |nodemon| rails s| You'll see something called puma running in terminal|

## How we will be using Rails

### Rails 5 / 6 API

Our Rails server will have the same purpose as our Node/Express server from Unit 3. It's going to serve only JSON.

Rails JSON APIs are used as powerful backends for Mobile apps and regular Desktop apps.

Rails 5:
> verify that you're running Rails 5 or higher with the command: `rails -v`

New in Rails 5 is the `--api` flag that we will be using.

This flag slims Rails down considerably, removing files, folders, and middleware, etc. that is not needed. The `--api` flag makes Rails much more lightweight.

<br>
<hr>

#  &#x2600; BUILD A NEW RAILS APP

To start a new rails app, you **do not** have to make a directory. Navigate to `student_examples`.

We are going to build an app called

### `intro_app_api`

The command to build our rails json api with postgres is the following:

```
rails new intro_app_api --api -d postgresql --skip-git
```

In English:

Hey `rails` make a `new` project called `intro_app_api` as just an `--api` (as opposed to full Rails, because we'll be rendering our views with React later), set the database `-d` to `postgresql`, and do not initialize this project with `git` (since we're doing this in our class repo, which is already a git repository, we don't want to cause git-ception, so we will `--skip-git`).

What's all this stuff, one more time?

* `rails new` will make a new project directory and populate it with folders and files
* The name of our app is `intro_app_api`. It's important to name it with `_api` to differentiate it from other apps later.
* The `--api` flag is new in Rails 5 and slims down the app just to serve json.
* With the `-d` flag we specify which type of database to use. In our case, we use `postgresql`.
* `--skip-git` skips Rails automatically running a `git init` in this new folder, which would mess us up for class. In most situations outside this classroom, you don't need this however.

You can learn more about the `rails new` command by running:

`rails new --help`

ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Made a mistake typing `rails new`? Just remove the folder that was created and re-run the command. It is far faster to do that than go into the config files and update stuffðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

<br>

Terminal feedback will look something like this:

<br>
<hr>

## Files and Folders

Now let's open up our new app in our text editor:

`cd intro_app_api`

`atom .`

![](https://i.imgur.com/sA1UmdB.png)

There are many files and folders that Rails makes for us. This is in stark contrast to Express that give us . . . a `package.json`.

| Comparison |Express| Rails|Comments|
|:-:|:-----:|:----:|:-------:|
|project meta-data| package.json | Gemfile | Rails 5+ has a `package.json` by default as well, but that's for extra stuff, not the main meta-data file|
| Server | Express | Puma/Rack |Puma is the server, Rack deals with the middleware, these are configured and arranged pretty differently from Express, so you won't see a `server` file in the root|
|Controllers| controllers | app/controllers | part of MVC |
| Models | models | app/models | part of MVC |
|Views|we used ejs (handlebars is another common one), but we also used React| erb, BUT! We won't use it, when we're ready we'll jump into using React|part of MVC|

We don't need to look inside these nooks and crannies. The idea is that Rails will do a bunch of stuff for us inside of these 'black boxes'. This is in contrast to Express where we see everything, including all the middleware config.

Rails gives you all this stuff and you just have to play along with it.

Almost everything you will ever do will be in the `app` folder.

You'll also do a bit in the `db` folder, in the `config` folder, and the `Gemfile`.

### For today we're focused only on two directories: `app/models` and `db`

&#x1F535; **Here's what we are going to do today:**

- Step One: make a database with table and columns
- Step Two: make a model and interact with it

This is all we will do. There are very specific processes for doing these things. Once these foundations are built, we can begin to free ourselves up a bit.

# &#x26A0; STEP ONE
#### &#x1F449;  MAKING A DATABASE WITH A TABLE AND COLUMNS

<br>
<hr>

# &#x1F449; CREATE DATABASE

`rails db:create` creates your postgres database based on the name of your Rails app.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DIlpKJY.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/nhUDDLk.png)

We can check that the database was created by typing

```
rails dbconsole
```

This will open up our postgres CLI.

Close it again with `\q`.

<!--SEI1 9:16 -->

# &#x1F449; MAKE COLUMNS FOR THE DATABASE

### MIGRATIONS

We create our database tables and give them columns through **Migrations**.

In Mongo, our table was a collection. Its 'columns' were the keys we used in our schema.

In SQL, this is a **table** that has **columns**.

In this application, we are going to make yet another ToDos thingy with very simple data.

&#x1F535; Open the `db` folder. We are going to make some changes to it. For the most part we will not interact with it directly, but rather will do so by generating and running **migrations**.

> Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organized manner.

> Migrations, using Ruby, are database-language independent.

First, create a migration in Terminal. This migration will allow us to make a **table** in our database:

```
rails generate migration CreateTodos

=> CREATED db/migrate/20191010152405_create_todos.rb
```

> `generate` can be shortened to `g`

> `Create` is a helper that will set up boilerplate for creating a table

- The migration generated a `migrate` folder in the `db` folder.
- Inside it is the migration file we created: `db/migrate/20191010152405_create_todos.rb`
- The migration file we just made will allow us to create a table with the columns we want.

The numbers are just a timestamp. All migration files are kept here in sequence so that we have a permanent record of all alterations to our database.

[Why do we use migrations?](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.8/migrations.html)

### GIVE THE MIGRATION SOME DATA

In the migration file: Use Ruby to specify what the columns and datatypes are for our table:

```ruby
class CreateTodos < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
     create_table :todos do |t|
        t.string :title
        t.boolean :completed
     end
  end
end
```

> **Note:** The column names are `symbols`

![](https://i.imgur.com/CJQr6At.png)

# &#x1F449;  Run the migration

We have created the migration, and we have told it what we want it to do. All that's left is to execute it.

When we run the migration it will create/alter our database.

Run the migration with `rails db:migrate`.

```
== 20190710152405 CreateTodosTable: migrating ===============================
== 20190710152405 CreateTodosTable: migrated (0.0000s) ======================
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/wz2VK6D.png)

### schema.rb

Running the migration created a `schema.rb` file. This is the schema for all your data.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PTqoX86.png)

#### DO NOT TOUCH THE SCHEMA.RB

*Not to be touched*. *DO NOT MODIFY IT*

Same goes for your migrations. Once you've run a migration *DO NOT TOUCH IT*.

<!--This is similar to editing a git commit after the fact--it causes weirdness and confuses the history of changes-->

### Check the database itself:

Open up the Postgres console:

```
$ rails dbconsole
```

See the columns created for the todos table:

```
SELECT * FROM todos;
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/pn9378E.png)

Quit with `\q`.

Now that our database has been constructed with tables and columns, let's get some data in there.

<!--SEI1 9:30 - 9:42 -->

### &#x2714; Step 1 complete: making a database with a table and columns

# &#x2600; BLOG APP

&#x1F535; **Activity (20 mins)**

In `student_examples` for today (**NOT inside your Rails project folder**), perform the following commands, and look back over the lesson to double-check that you are writing the correct syntax. If you get it wrong, you'll probably have to delete the app and start over.

* Make a new Rails app called `blog_app_api`.
* Remember the `--api` flag. If you forget, **delete this app and start over**.
* Remember the `-d postgresql`. If you forget, **delete this app and start over**.
* Create the db.
* Generate a migration for creating a table called **posts**. `rails g migration CreatePosts`.
* In the migration file, set up the `posts` table to have columns for `title`, `author`, and `content` (all strings).
* Run the migration.
* Check the schema, and check the database:

`schema.rb` correct result:

![](https://i.imgur.com/IIJDqKn.png)

In `rails dbconsole`

`SELECT * FROM posts;`

Correct result:

<!--SEI1 10:12 -->

# &#x26A0; STEP TWO
#### &#x1F449; MAKING A MODEL AND INTERACTING WITH IT

<br>
<hr>

# &#x1F449; CREATE MODEL

Navigate back to our `intro_app_api` where we are making the **Todos**:

In order to perform database queries using Ruby, we need to create a Todo model in `app/models`

Make a file called `todo.rb` in `app/models`.

`todo.rb` **MUST BE LOWERCASE AND SINGULAR**. Rails wants to help you with its **conventions**.

In the file, tell our model to inherit from `ApplicationRecord`:

`Todo`, the class name, **MUST BE CAPITALIZED AND SINGULAR**. Keep it **conventional**. A rule of thumb is that model names are singular, but controllers are plural.

```ruby
class Todo < ApplicationRecord
end
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/BbOk24s.png)

All this does for now is wire up our app so that we use Active Record on our Todo model to interface with our database.

# &#x1F449; ACTIVE RECORD

Active Record, as an ORM Framework, gives us several mechanisms, the most important being the ability to:

- represent models and their data
- represent associations between these models
- represent inheritance hierarchies through related models
- validate models before they are saved into the database
- perform database operations in an object-oriented fashion

Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic.

It's like `Mongoose`. With `Mongoose`, we did not have to write raw `Mongo` queries, and instead could use `Mongoose`'s helper methods. With `ActiveRecord`, we do not have to write raw SQL queries, and can instead write Ruby to query the database.

> **TLDR:** ActiveRecord is to SQL as Mongoose is to Mongo.

In addition, we can open up a console and just write `ActiveRecord` queries directly (we couldn't do this with `Mongoose`).

## Rails console

Open Rails console

```
rails console
```

OR

```
rails c
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/4uRBFpl.png)

* We can see that our `Todos` model exists and that we can perform `ActiveRecord` queries on it, and we can see the SQL statement used to query the database:

```ruby
Todo.all
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/s6MbslU.png)

There are no Todos yet, but the query works!

```ruby
Todo.count
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lp6mWi5.png)

Yup, zero todos.

### Create and Save new Todos

<!--Tell students not to follow along, they will get a chance with the activity -->
<!--Basically the same as mongoose...but I think it's insert instead of save-->

- `.new` (creates a new `ActiveRecord` object template, but doesn't save it to the DB)
- `.save` (saves a new `ActiveRecord` object template to the database)
- `.create` (calls `.new` + `.save`)

```ruby
todo = Todo.new(title: "First todo", completed: true)
todo.save
```

```ruby
Todo.create(title: "Something", completed: false)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/lZOqs5V.png)

### Query Todos

- `.find` (finds by id)

```ruby
Todo.find(1)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/MjTMsad.png)

- `.where` (takes a key value pairs as arguments to search by)

```ruby
Todo.where(title: "Something", completed: false)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/QkiKLyK.png)

### Update Todos

- `.update` (takes key value pairs as arguments, with the fields to update)

```ruby
todo = Todo.find(2)
todo.update(completed: true)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/B7A9nlZ.png)

Or chain the commands together:

```ruby
Todo.find(2).update(completed: true)
```

### Delete Todos

- `.destroy` can either be called on an ActiveRecord object or takes the id of an ActiveRecord object

```ruby
Todo.destroy(1)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/E83FDGb.png)

OR

```ruby
Todo.find(1).destroy
```

We will be using these Active Record queries within Rails.

<!--SEI1 10:30 -->

&#x1F535; **Activity (10 mins)**

Using rails console `rails c`:

1. Create a new `Todo`
2. Query `Todo` to see how many there are in the db
3. Create another `Todo`
4. Update the second `Todo`
5. Query `Todo` to see all of them
5. Delete the first `Todo`

Type `exit` to leave Rails Console

### &#x2714; Step Two complete: making a model and interacting with it

## Aside

Rails has conventions on how to pluralize and singularize words.

If you would like to check the singular or plural of a word, you can do it by opening `rails c` and running `.pluralize` (to quit, type `quit`).
