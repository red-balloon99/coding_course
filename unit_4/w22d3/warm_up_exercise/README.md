# Technical Interview Questions

A lot of interviews will ask you to solve questions that relate to problem solving in computer science.  While you may never see these problems in your day-to-day, a lot of companies see these problems as a way to examine your problem-solving skills, and your command of the language you most often code in.  Even if you don't see these problems in an interview, they are a good way to practice converting (albeit nerdy) human problems into coded solutions (which you will definitely have to do on the job).

## Directions

It may be a good idea to quickly review the Whiteboarding Techniques in this [whiteboarding-101](https://github.com/den-materials/whiteboarding-101) lesson before you dive into these questions.

- People will be randomly paired up in breakout rooms.
- Partner #1 will ask the first question below, and Partner #2 will try to answer, using the whiteboard.  
- After 10 minutes, Partner #1 should share at least 2 Glows and 2 Grows. Don't worry too much about syntax, focus on the big picture. For instance:
  - Did they communicate their ideas well?
  - Is there a more efficient way to solve the problem?
- Then Partner #2 will ask the second question below, and Partner #1 will try to answer, using the whiteboard.
- After 10 minutes, Partner #2 will share their Glows and Grows.

## Array Sum Problem

You have an array of integers, and you want to map them to another array that satisfies the following:

For each index of the original array, you want to replace it with the sum of every integer **except** the integer at that index.  

Write a function for this mapping.

## Decimal to Binary

<!--Go through a quick review of binary vs decimal place values-->

Write a function that can convert a decimal number into a string of its binary equivalent.

If there is extra time, how might you reverse the process?
