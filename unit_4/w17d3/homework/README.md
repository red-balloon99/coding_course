## Activity

Congratulations everyone on completing unit 3! Now, let's move on to Unit 4! In this next unit, we'll be using a different programming language aside from JavaScript called Ruby. To get you prepared for our first Ruby lessons, we want you to at least see the new language in action and get some practice with it. Below, we've linked three different tutorials/guides that you can go through to begin familiarizing yourself with the language. We have structured these activities into three tiers: **Must Have**, **Should Have**, and **Hungry for More**

## Must Have

1. [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex1.html) - make sure to click the table of contents in the upper left corner to find more exercises. **You should finish through exercise 22, as well as exercises 29 and 30.**

    </details>
1. [Codeacademy Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) - you will have to create an account, but it's free for the first week! (If you already have an account with an expired trial, we won't tell anyone if you sign in with a different email to get the same deal again. :smirk:). **You should finish the Introduction to Ruby section.**

## Should Have

1. [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex1.html) - **finish through exercise 41**
1. [Codeacademy Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) - **You should finish the Control Flow and Looping with Ruby sections.**

## Hungry for More

1. Finish [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex1.html)
1. Finish [Codeacademy Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)
1. Start [The Bastard's Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/toc/)

#### While you go through the above tutorials, we suggest particularly paying attention on:

1. Printing something in the console (the equivalent to console.log() in JavaScript)
1. Writing an if/else statement
1. Defining a method/function and calling it

## Homework Submission

Honor system - there won't be any submissions for tonight's homework! The only consequence of you not getting through the **Must Have** and some of the **Should Have** is that you won't fully absorb the material in our first Ruby lesson...which will make you not fully absorb the second.... We're sure you've felt this effect before, so do your best this weekend!
