# &#x1F34E; CORS

You should have received this error message when getting your `localhost:3001` server to query your `localhost:3000` server:

What's going on, here?

## same-origin policy

Browsers implement a security feature called **same-origin policy**. The idea is that Javascript requests to a server are rejected if they come from a different origin. AJAX requests can't make requests to other servers than the one they're coming from.

**TLDR: By default, Ajax requests must have the same origin and destination.**

> An origin is the combination of port, protocol and host.

To allow the browser to make a request to a different origin, we have to tell the server to accept cross-origin requests.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a technique for relaxing the same-origin policy, allowing Javascript on a web page to consume a REST API served from a different origin.
>
> [Understanding CORS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-cors)

Any production API has to deal with the **same-origin policy** and enable CORS if a frontend server is to consume that API.

>**GOTCHA:** You might run into CORS issues when you try to consume a third-party API. Many projects have floundered because of third-party API CORS issues. For this reason and others, we recommend hitting the third-party API from the backend if at all possible.

# &#x1F527; CONFIGURE RAILS FOR CORS

Let's tell Rails to send through that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header that our browser is freakin' out about.

* Uncomment the rack-cors gem in the Gemfile `gem 'rack-cors'` around line 28.

`Gemfile`:

[More on the rack-cors Gem](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors)

* Run `bundle` on the command line to install the Gemfile gems

In the file `config/initializers/cors.rb`

* Uncomment the code in `cors.rb` that begins with

`Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors`

The address after origins is a _whitelist_ of domains where requests are allowed to originate. We can add as many as we like, separated by commas.

Change origins to the address where your frontend requests will be coming from. In our case, let's whitelist `localhost:3001` (or whatever default port Create React App is using).

![](https://i.imgur.com/ghxY51s.png)

We could whitelist

* the local version of the frontend app
* a hosted version of your frontend app
* an 'admin' version of the frontend app that makes alterations to the db and block other apps from doing so
* everything at once using `*`.

In the future, we might want to block apps from being able to alter the database in any way. In that case we would omit :post, :put, etc. For now let's keep all of the methods (:get, :post, :put, etc.) and the one local address.

**IMPORTANT: RESTART THE SERVER**

The changes will not apply if you do not kill and start the server, since we changed the configuration of the Rails app.

## MAKE AJAX REQUEST

In your frontend app, make the request to the backend app.

> In Chrome and other browsers, the origin will be 'remembered' even if you change the CORS settings in the backend app. To reset, empty the browser's cache.

The request should work:

The data will be in the **data** object (100 notices).

If killing and restarting Rails, and hard refreshing (`cmd-shift-f`) your browser did not resolve the CORS error, you might have to start your browser with **same-origin policy** disabled:

`open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir`

However, please let an instructor know if you have to run this, because it may hinder your progress during the next project week.
