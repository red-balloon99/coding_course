# JavaScript - OOP Factories

<!--SEI1 1:44-->

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a Factory
1. Bonus - static properties for a class

## Create a factory

- Sometimes we need to have a factory object that will generate other similar objects
- The purpose of the factory is so it can control the creation process in some way
- This is usually a single object that exists throughout the program that performs a set of operations
	- Also called a _singleton_

Let's start with a car

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor (make, serialNumber) {
    this.serialNumber = serialNumber;
    this.make = make;
  }
  drive () {
    console.log('Vroom Vroom');
  }
}

const newCar = new Car('Mazda', 12345);
console.log(newCar);
```

Now let's make a factory class that will make cars for us.

```javascript

class Factory {
  constructor (company) {
    this.company = company;
    this.cars = [];
  }
  generateCar () {
    const newCar = new Car(this.company, this.cars.length);
    this.cars.push(newCar);
  }
  findCar (index) {
    return this.cars[index];
  }
}
const tesla = new Factory('Tesla');
tesla.generateCar();
tesla.generateCar();
tesla.generateCar();
tesla.generateCar();
console.log(tesla);
console.log(tesla.findCar(0));
```

Now we can easily create another new factory that produces its own cars

```js
const porsche = new Factory('Porsche');
porsche.generateCar();
porsche.generateCar();
console.log(porsche);
console.log(porsche.findCar(0));
```

<!--If you are generating complex cards like we saw in the Flexbox lesson,
or if you are building a video game with 100s of similar objects (enemies, balloons, etc)
this Factory design pattern is very useful-->

## Extra
### Create static properties for a class

Sometimes you want to define properties that pertain to the class as a whole, not the instance.  This allows us to limit, somewhat, what the user of class can do.

```javascript
class Person {
  static eyeColors () {
    return ['blue', 'green', 'brown'];
  }
  // rest of class definition here...
}
// more code...
const superman = new SuperHero('Clark Kent', 30, Person.eyeColors()[0], 'black');
```

<!--A student may ask why we want to use something like this
A big use case is if we need to combine two instances that are of the same class
remember the mama-cat papa-cat function?  That would most likely be a static
method.

In the end, static methods are just a way of organizing methods into their proper
category--i.e. this is a function that works for a Person
Object.keys is one that we've seen before, and it is supposed to be used on Objects-->
