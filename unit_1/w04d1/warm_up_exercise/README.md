# Warm Up

Let's take 10 - 15 minutes to write a function that capitalizes the first letter in a word

When you go on a job interview and are given a code challenge, you won't be able to google 'how to capitalize a word using js'. The interviewers will be looking for your problem solving skills.

So start building them by imagining this is for a job interview.

There are only two rules for your solution:

<!--Trying to even the playing field here a bit, so even experienced devs have to struggle a bit.-->

1) You must *not* use a pre-built JS function that capitalizes letters or words.
2) You must *not* use any materials you find on Google--class materials are totally fine, though.

We're taking this back to basics--start small, and work through the steps. You've got this!

```js
const capitalize = (word) => {
 // your code here
}

capitalize('hello') // 'Hello'
capitalize('howdy') // 'Howdy'
capitalize('aloha') // 'Aloha'
```
