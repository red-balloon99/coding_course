## MERN Delete

Open up your `holidays` app from last class, and open `holidays_front_end` in `atom`.

Let's add a new table cell in our table:

**App.js**

```js
<tbody>
  { this.state.holidays.map(holiday => {
      <tr key={holiday._id} >
        <td> {holiday.name }</td>
        <td>X</td>
      </tr>
    )
  }
</tbody>
```

Let's add a function called `deleteHoliday`. It will do two things: make a call to our api to delete the holiday and **then** update our view to reflect our data:

```js
deleteHoliday = (id) => {
  fetch(baseURL + '/holidays/' + id, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  }).then( response => {
    const findIndex = this.state.holidays.findIndex(holiday => holiday._id === id)
    const copyHolidays = [...this.state.holidays]
    copyHolidays.splice(findIndex, 1)
    this.setState({holidays: copyHolidays})
  })
}
```

Now we'll add a click event to our new `td`

>**Gotcha:** In order to pass an argument in our click event, we have to wrap our function inside an anonymous function.

```js
<td onClick={()=>this.deleteHoliday(holiday._id)}>X</td>
```

Test this new functionality by clicking on the `X` and making sure your holiday is removed from the list. Then refresh the page to make sure the holiday is gone from the DB, too.
