# MERN Simple Update

We have one more letter in CRUD to cover - the Update piece!

One easy way to update data on the front end is to alter the way our app looks (change CSS) based on that data.

With that in mind, we will gray out our holidays if we have `celebrated` them (a boolean, defaulted to `false`).

Let's write a toggle function

```js
toggleCelebrated = (holiday) => {
  fetch(baseURL + '/holidays/' + holiday._id, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify({celebrated: !holiday.celebrated}),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type' : 'application/json'
    }
  }).then(res => res.json())
  .then(resJson => {
       const copyHolidays = [...this.state.holidays]
        const findIndex = this.state.holidays.findIndex(holiday => holiday._id === resJson._id)
        copyHolidays[findIndex].celebrated = resJson.celebrated
        this.setState({holidays: copyHolidays})
  })
}
```

Add an `onDoubleClick` event listener to the holiday name and toggle the css of the name. Again, because we need to pass an argument we have to wrap our function in an anonymous function for our event handler:

```js
<td
  onDoubleClick={() => this.toggleCelebrated(holiday)}
  className={holiday.celebrated
    ? 'celebrated'
    :
    null}
>
  {holiday.name}
</td>
```

## Your turn

<!--Leave this as an independent activity-->

Create the functionality to increase the number of `likes` by clicking an image of balloons

Add two new `td`s in the `App.js` row for each holiday
- one that has the total number of likes
- one that has an image of a balloon

```js
<td>{holiday.likes}</td>
<td><img src={ballons} alt="ballons"/></td>
```

Now add a function called `updateLikes` that actually adds 1 to the `likes` of a given holiday.  Add an `onClick` listener that calls this function to the ballons `td`.

### Bonus

Most of the functionality for this bonus is built into `components/UpdateForm.js`.

Create the functionality to update all the fields with a form that pops up as a modal:

- make sure that the form is pre-populated with values

```js
 <td><img src={pencil} alt="pencil" onClick={this.toggleUpdateForm}/></td>
```
