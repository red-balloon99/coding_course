# MERN Stack

An app built with Mongo, Express, React and Node is often referred to as using the MERN stack.

We've been building the back end and now it's time to build the React layer.

There is starter code in the examples folder, in case you need it.  Don't forget to run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. You can also keep working from your previous days' work.

We're going to be using the `index.html` in the `public` folder as our main entry point. We'll continue to use the script tags for React and Babel.

We are keeping our tooling simple so it will be easy for you to host your project on Heroku. Tools like Webpack are great! But there is a lot to learn about them. In the interest of time, we'll focus on React and leave developer tools, development/production set up aside for now.

As you research on your own you'll see that, often, the backend server is separate from the client server - we'll do this in Unit 4.

If you haven't already  -

- `mkdir public`
- `cd public`
- `mkdir css`
- `touch css/main.css`
- `mkdir js`
- `cd js`
- `touch app.js`
- `mkdir components`

### Mock up

![base mock up](https://i.imgur.com/fbKM3zW.png)

We have ~ 3 components

- top level app that will have the
  - header
  - form
  - list

- form
  - input text
  - input submit

- todos
 - to do
 - delete to do
 - complete to do
 - will click or doubleclick item to edit it


But for simplicity, we'll just make one component with state. If we have some time left over we'll break our app into more than one component.


### Plan
- **Create** We'll start on to creating new ToDos
- **Read** Then we'll mov on to rendering our todos. We've been building this app and testing it so we should have some items in there, if we don't we can use the command line to cURL at least one todo.

- **Delete** We'll make a little x to click on that will delete our todo
- **Update Simple** - We'll click on the checkmark and set our todo as complete. We'll change the css of our completed todos.

Bonuses - if we have time/do as a lab:
- **Update w. Form** - We'll add a form to update one todo's text

- Break our app into  multiple components

### Create

Get started. Remember the minimum a React Component must do is render something.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1> To Dos </h1>
        <form>
          <label htmlFor='description'>description</label>
          <input type='text' value='' id='description' />
          <input type='submit' />
        </form>
        <h2></h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)
```

Update our form to be ready to take in data. We'll temporarily tack on an h2 so we can see that our state is changing with our input

```js
render () {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> To Dos </h1>
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor='description'>Description</label>
        <input type='text' value={this.state.description} onChange={this.handleChange} id='description' />
        <input type='submit' />
      </form>
      <h2>{this.state.description}</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```


Write our functions to handle input and don't forget to bind `this` in the constructor

```js
constructor (props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    description: '',
    todos: []
  }
  this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
  this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
}
handleChange (event) {
  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
}
handleSubmit (event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.log(this.state)
}
```

That should feel like old hat! The new part will be sending our data over to our server using `fetch`. We'll do this on `submit`. We'll also add our new item to our todos array.

```js
handleSubmit (event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  fetch('/todos', {
    body: JSON.stringify({ description: this.state.description }),
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json, text/plain, */*',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  })
    .then(createdToDo => {
      return createdToDo.json()
    })
    .then(jsonedToDo => {
      // reset the form
      // add person to list
      this.setState({
        description: '',
        todos: [jsonedToDo, ...this.state.todos]
      })
      console.log(jsonedToDo)
    })
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
}

```

When we console.log our `jsonedToDo`, we should get back something with a mongoID :

That means this item is coming from our database!
