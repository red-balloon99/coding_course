We will want to populate our list with todos from our database.

We'll want to do it on page load. We can write a fetch request, similar to the ones we wrote for our third party APIs

```js
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      console.log(todos);
    })
```

Where can we put this function so it gets called on page load?

There is the possibility of calling it in the `constructor`, however this is a bit dangerous, as this is asynchronous and there is no guarantee that the data response and the render will happen in the correct order.

Rather, we'll have to rely on a React lifecycle method called `componentDidMount()`. Lifecycle methods are methods that are triggered on certain events on a component, like when it is mounted on the page, or unmounted... and many more.

For now, we'll just use this one method to make a fetch request on page load. It's important to note that this is a special built-in method and it must be spelled exactly.


Let's try it

```js
componentDidMount () {
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      console.log(todos)
    })
}
```

We should see an array of our ToDos in our console.

Now we want to see our Todos. In `this.state`, we already added an empty array for todos. We can set our todos from our database to this.

```js
componentDidMount () {
  fetch('/todos')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(todos => {
      this.setState({
        todos: todos
      })
    })
}
```

Let's add a table to our component, later we'll add functionality to an  edit and a delete button, a table will help give us sensible vertical alignment

```js
<table>
  <tbody>
    {this.state.todos.map(todo => {
      return (
        <tr>
          <td> {todo.description} </td>
          <td> X </td>
          <td> complete </td>
        </tr>
      )
    })}
  </tbody>
</table>
```
