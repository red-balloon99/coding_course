# MERN Stack

<!--SEI1 12:47-->

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe the elements of the MERN stack
1. Set up static files
1. Set up React using Create React App
1. Get Data from our holidays_api app
1. Do rest of CRUD

## Describe the elements of the MERN stack

MERN stack is just a collection of technologies that work well together:

- Mongo
- Express
- React
- Node.js

We're going to have two apps: One will be our `create-react-app` that will handle the front end.

The other is our backend express API.

It is increasingly common to have a separate back end that just handles data: desktop and mobile apps are different apps for a user to use, but it makes sense they'd share the backend/data rather than building out that portion twice.

We're going to make a top level folder that will hold both of our apps:

## Create React App

1. `cd holidays_front_end`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

What we're building:

## Get Data from Our API

First, we'll need to store our data in the `state` of our App.

`src/App.js`:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
 state = {
   holidays: []
 }
 render () {
   return (
     <div className='container'>
      <h1>Holidays! Celebrate!</h1>
     </div>
   )
 }
}
```

We can use `fetch` to make database calls for us

```js
console.log('current base URL:', baseURL)

fetch(baseURL+ '/holidays')
  .then(data => {
    return data.json()},
    err => console.log(err))
  .then(parsedData => console.log(parsedData),
   err => console.log(err))
```

We will likely receive a CORS ERROR

For safety reasons, requests with different origins are blocked by default.

We'll have to move over to our backend and add an npm package called `cors`

If you don't already have a tab open within `holidays_api`, then open a new tab and `cd` to `holidays_api`:

- `npm install cors`

- in `holidays_api/server.js`, add the following to your other dependencies:

```js
const cors = require('cors')
```

<!--SEI1 1:11 -->

- further down, with your other middleware

Note: we only need localhost for this build, but we will give you an example of how to limit CORS to a white list for your project (i.e. your localhost and your api on heroku)

**server.js** (express backend)
```js
const whitelist = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://fathomless-sierra-68956.herokuapp.com']
const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true)
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
    }
  }
}

app.use(cors(corsOptions)) // Note: all routes are now exposed. If you want to limit access for specific verbs like POST or DELETE you can look at the npm documentaion for cors (for example with OMDB - it's ok for anyone to see the movies, but you don't want just anyone adding a movie)
```

Now in your console you should be able to see your holidays coming back from your express backend api!

## Show A list of Holidays

Right now we're just calling this fetch upon load of this React app. But we want to be able to call this functionality again and again.

Inside the class `App`, let's put this code inside a function:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
 state = {
   holidays: []
 }
 getHolidays = () => {
   fetch(baseURL+ '/holidays')
     .then(data => {
       return data.json()},
       err => console.log(err))
     .then(parsedData => console.log(parsedData),
      err=> console.log(err))
 }
 // ...
}
```

## When to call `getHolidays`

We want to call `getHolidays` when we render the app. If we put it in the `render` function, we'll create an infinite loop (every `render` will update `state`, which would then trigger `render` which would then update `state`, etc). So where do we put it?

We need a more surefire way to call this function at the right time. React has some `lifecycle` methods for exactly this purpose. We may want to run things when a component is mounted on the DOM, when a component is unmounted, when it is updated and more. We will use `componentDidMount` for our purpose.

[lifecycle flow chart](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/componentdidmakesense-react-lifecycle-explanation-393dcb19e459)

```js
componentDidMount(){
  this.getHolidays()
}
```

We should still see our holiday(s) from our express API console logging.

>**Note:** Many of these lifecycle methods have been made obsolete by new developments in recent versions of React. Check the React documentation if you aren't sure of which function to use (or not use).

Now we want to set that data in `state`. How would we do that in `getHolidays`?

<!--
getHolidays = () => {
  fetch(baseURL+ '/holidays')
    .then(data => {
      return data.json()},
      err => console.log(err))
    .then(parsedData => this.setState({
      holidays: parsedData
    }),
     err=> console.log(err))
}
-->

Finally, we want to `render` it:

```js
<h1>Holidays! Celebrate!</h1>
<table>
  <tbody>
    { this.state.holidays.map(holiday =>
          <tr key={holiday._id} >
            <td> {holiday.name }</td>
          </tr>
      )
    }
  </tbody>
</table>
```
