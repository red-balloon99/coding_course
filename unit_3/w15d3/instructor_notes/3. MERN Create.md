## MERN Stack Create

Just like we did in Unit 2, we will need a `form` to `create` new items. We'll make this a separate component.

Add `NewForm.js` into the `components` folder:

**NewForm.js**

```js
import React from 'react'

class NewForm extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (

    )
  }
}

export default NewForm
```

Add a `state` that keeps track of the `name` for the holiday:

```js
class NewForm extends React.Component {
  state = {
    name: ''
  }
  // ...
```

And put a `form` inside our `render` function.

```js
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
  <label htmlFor="name"></label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.name} placeholder="add a holiday"/>
  <input type="submit" value="Add a Reason to Celebrate"/>
</form>
```

**App.js**

```js
import NewForm from './components/NewForm.js'
// further down
return (
  <div className='container'>
   <h1>Holidays! Celebrate!</h1>
   <NewForm />
   <table>
```

<!--Make sure you show the semi-complete form before moving on -->

Let's build out our `handleSubmit` and `handleChange` functions:

<!--SEI1 1:41 -->

**NewForm.js**

```js
handleChange = (event) => {
  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value})
}
```

In order to update the page with our new holiday, we have to send this data back up to our App component so it can be passed down to the current list of holidays. We also need the `baseURL` in `App.js` to make our `POST` request. We will pass both of these into `NewForm` as `props`.

<!--SEI1 1:51 -->

**App.js**

```js
handleAddHoliday = (holiday) => {
  const copyHolidays = [...this.state.holidays]
  copyHolidays.unshift(holiday)
  this.setState({
    holidays: copyHolidays,
    name: ''
  })
}
// further down (in render)
<NewForm
  baseURL={baseURL}
  handleAddHoliday={this.handleAddHoliday}
/>
```

To submit, we have to prevent the default behavior of the form.

We then have to make a `fetch` request. When we were just making a `get` request, we just needed one argument, a string. However, for any other action, we have to add a second argument: an object with other options.

We'll have to add a `method`, a `body` (the data from our form), and some `headers` to this object.

**THEN** when we get a response we need to convert it to `json`.

**THEN** we want to take that json-ed response and add our new holiday to our list, using the `handleAddHoliday` function passed down from `App.js`.

```js
handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  fetch(this.props.baseURL + '/holidays', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({name: this.state.name}),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }).then (res => res.json())
    .then (resJson => {
      this.props.handleAddHoliday(resJson)
      this.setState({
        name: ''
      })
  }).catch (error => console.error({'Error': error}))
}
```

Add a new holiday, using this form, and make sure it is added to your list. Then refresh the page, and make sure the new holiday is still there (meaning it's in the DB now).
