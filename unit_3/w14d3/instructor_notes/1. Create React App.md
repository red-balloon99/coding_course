# Intro to Create React App

<!--SEI1 10:23 -->

## Learning Objectives

 - Learn about Create React App
 - Review All the React we learned in previous lessons by rebuilding our app in Create React App
 - Learn what some of the pros and cons of Create React App are
 - Learn how to build an app with Create React App

## It's 2019 Y'all

If you've googled anything about what to learn to be a web developer, you've likely been overwhelmingly crushed by the number of tools, technologies and buckets full of acronym soup.

All of these tools are meant to solve problems. But with too many tools, this can be a problem in and of itself. Which one(s) do you learn? Additionally, as new web devs, a lot of the tools can seem like total magic and it can be really hard to figure out what is what and it can even impede learning when you take on too much too fast. Especially when the documentation is not very good.

So we've been really selective about which tools we teach. We want to present tools that will serve you well post-course.

**Create React App** is built buy Facebook and it is meant for:
- Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment (good errors! warnings, notes about best practices, hot reloading, zero configuration)
- Starting new single page applications
- Creating Examples with React for your libraries and components

[More info](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app)

Create React App isn't the best choice for:
- A sandbox where you just want to try some samples out
- A mostly static site (portfolio, blog, most Project 1s)
- Apps with server-side rendering (yes! With a front-end framework! What is next? Cats and dogs being friends?!) - look into Next.js for apps like this

Takeaway - soon you'll be on your own and you'll be trying to learn new things and get ready for job interviews. How do you figure out what to learn?
- Figure out what you want to build and THEN figure out the right tools
- Start small and then add what you need
- Look at the job market and learn something that seems to be popular in the area

## Let's get started

Let's build a playlist maker. Something like this:

[Create React Docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- `npm i -g create-react-app`
- `create-react-app tunr_app`
- `cd tunr_app`
- `rm -rf .git` - because we are in the class repository - no git repos inside other git repos!
- open a new tab in terminal
- `npm start`
- in the other open tab `atom .`

Before we look at our files, let's talk about `import`.  If you haven't seen this before, it's very similar to `require` in Node.  It allows us to bring other files and `node_modules` into a given JS file.

>**Note:** It is worth pointing out that `require` and `import` are two separate solutions to the same problem (including other files), but they do not always play nicely with each other.  In general, `require` works on a Node back-end, and `import` works on an ES6 front-end, but it takes some extra work to put `require` on the front-end, or `import` on the back-end.

Let's look at our folders:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ovMXd4n.png)

The `public` folder holds static assets like the favicon and the `index.html` that will load in the browser.

<!--Remember when we did this in Unit 2? -->

The `src` folder has a lot new things:

- `App.css` - a different way to organize and use CSS than what we are used to, because it is `import`ed directly into `App.js`.
  - [As a bonus you can learn this way](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-stylesheet).
- `App.js` - the main React component, we'll be writing most of our code in here.
- `App.test.js` - we haven't gotten a chance to dive into testing, but if you look at the code, in summary it says if the app doesn't crash, load it.
- `index.css` - if you do your css in here, it will be most familiar to what we've already been doing in the course.
- `index.js` - this file starts the show. Notice the familiar `ReactDOM.render` and the `import` of `App`. This is where we actually put our elements on the webpage.
- `logo.svg`-that's that spinning react logo you see in the browser. SVG is a really great technology worth exploring sometime later...
- `serviceWorker.js`, rather than an express app serving our web pages, this service worker is helping us interact with our app in the browser. [More info](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/). Service workers are basically a JS file that runs separately from our actual webpage, and are instrumental in offline capabilities and website optimization, but are a rabbit hole we don't have time for at the moment.

>**Note**: If you need to add a dependency/library, you can just run `npm install react-router-dom` or any other dependency you might want, just like you would with a Node project.

## Let's Get Coding
- Open the `src` folder
- Open the `App.js` file
- Replace the text inside the `p` tag with `Pleased to meet you!`

![](https://i.imgur.com/SSM71Qt.png)
- save the file
- look at the browser

![](https://i.imgur.com/pNIo19B.png)

Notice that you didn't have to reload the browser! ðŸŽ‰

This feature is called "hot reloading", and saves us a lot of time when developing on the front end.

<!--SEI1 10:59 -->

## Make This App Our Own

Let's rebuild our app from yesterday and then build on top of it.

First, let's remove all the create react app showcase stuff:

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTvcaIx.png)

Our component should now look familiar to the one from earlier lessons.

Two new things are the `import` and `export` portions.

For every component, we'll need to import `React` and export at least one thing, usually the component itself.

Our `App` component is our top level component that will be our main entry into our app and contain our main components.

- Inside the `div` let's add back an `h1` inside a header:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Tunr</h1>
</header>
```

## Add some 'data'

- `touch src/data.js`
- paste the following into `data.js`

```js
const playlists =
  {
    title: 'Playlist 1',
    created: Date.now(),
    songs: [
      {
        artist: 'Talking Heads',
        title: 'Once in a Lifetime',
        time: '3:37',
      },
      {
        artist: 'The Clash',
        title: 'Lost in the Supermarket',
        time: '3:44',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Peter Gabriel',
        title: 'Shaking the Tree',
        time: '7:24',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Slowdive',
        title: 'Don\'t Know Why',
        time: '4:42',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Joanna Serrat',
        title: 'Keep on Fallin\'',
        time: '4:47',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Tullycraft',
        title: 'Hearts at the Sound',
        time: '3:44',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Dead Sara',
        title: 'Something Good',
        time: '4:39',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Chaka Khan',
        title: 'Like Sugar',
        time: '4:01',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Alvvays',
        title: 'Lollipop (Ode to Jim)',
        time: '4:39',
      },
      {
        artist: 'Mazzy Star',
        title: 'Flowers in December',
        time: '4:23',
      }
    ]
  }
```


- add `export default playlists` at the bottom of this file

- in `App.js` add

```js
import playlists from './data.js'
console.log(playlists)
```

<!-- Apologize for this-->

- Functions are cool, but let's rewrite this component to be a `class`

```
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header>
          <h1>Tunr</h1>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Add `playlists` to State
```js
state = {
  playlists
}
```

Check your browser's dev tools console to see the 'data'

<!--SEI1 11:12 -->

Looking at our mockup, we probably want a div that will hold all of our playlists.

Right now, we have one playlist. For each playlist let's have a div. Let's give them both classes.

And let's build out a table for our playlists

```js
<div className="App">
  <div className="playlist">\
    <h3>{this.state.playlists.title}</h3>
    <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Artist</th>
         <th>Title</th>
         <th>Time</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].artist}</td>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].title}</td>
         <td>{this.state.playlists.songs[0].time}</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
  </div>
</div>
```

<!--SEI1 11:21 -->

Let's loop through our playlist and add rows for each song

```js
<tbody>
  {this.state.playlists.songs.map(song => {
    return (
      <tr>
        <td>{song.artist}</td>
        <td>{song.title}</td>
        <td>{song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</tbody>
```

Uh-oh we get an error:

![](https://i.imgur.com/RjCFPbe.png)

Create React App is going to keep giving us errors and warnings to be sure we're following best practices. Let's do what it says and add a unique key. Since this is fake data from an array we can just use the array index position for now. This isn't a foolproof way to add a unique key because index positions can change. But once we start using real data we can use the `id`

Let's fix the error

```js
<tbody>
  {this.state.playlists.songs.map((song, index) => {
    return (
      <tr key={index}>
        <td>{song.title}</td>
        <td>{song.artist}</td>
        <td>{song.time}</td>
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</tbody>
```

<!--SEI1 11:30 -->

## Set Up Inputs in a Form

Now let's add a form so we can add new songs. Between our `h3` and the `table`.

```html
<form>
  <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.playlists.title} id='title'/>
</form>
```

Let's handle the input

- add `title: ''` to `state`

- add a `handleChange` function

```js
handleChange = (event) => {
  this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
}
```

Add the event listener

```js
    <input type='text' value={this.state.title} onChange={this.handleChange} id='title' />
```

Add the rest of the fields to `state`:

```js
state = {
  playlists,
  title: '',
  artist: '',
  time: '0:00',
}
```

<!--SEI1 11:40 -->

## Make a Preview

We don't need this, but it may help us visualize our state as we continue to build for now.  Put the following after the `form`:

```js
<div>
  <h2>Preview our new song</h2>
  <h3>{this.state.title}</h3>
  <h4>{this.state.artist}</h4>
  <h5>{this.state.time}</h5>
</div>
```


Let's build out the rest of the form:

```html
<form>
  <label htmlFor='artist'>artist</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.artist} id='artist' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.title} id='title' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <label htmlFor='time'>time</label>
  <input type='text' value={this.state.time} id='time' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  <input type='submit' />
</form>
```

And add our soon-to-exist submit function:

```html
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```

Now we will write our submit function.

Because we have a nested array inside our object (songs), we are going to have to get a little fancy with some newer JS.

Remember, we should not ever mutate state directly. We must update state with `this.setState()`.

First, we're going to create a new object with our `state` we collected from our inputs.

Then we are going to make a new array, using the destructuring spread operator.

Finally, inside of `setState`, we'll update our songs array to our new array:

```js
handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const newSong = {
    title: this.state.title,
    artist: this.state.artist,
    time: this.state.time
  }

  const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]

  this.setState({
    playlists: {
      songs: updatedSongs
    },
    name: '',
    artist: '',
    time: '0:00'
  })
}
```

Oh no! If you notice the `Playlist 1` that was at the top of our site has gone away. Can you figure out why?

Our playlist `state` consists of an object with a `songs`, `created` and `title` key. But when we add another song, we tell our React app to set the playlist's state to only a `songs` key with a value of the updated songs. What we need to do is to tell our app to keep all of the information that was in our playlists object the same and only update the `songs` key. We can do that with the spread operator!

```js
handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const newSong = {
    title: this.state.title,
    artist: this.state.artist,
    time: this.state.time
  }

  const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]

  this.setState({
    playlists: {
      ...playlists,
      songs: updatedSongs
    },
    name: '',
    artist: '',
    time: '0:00'
  })
}
```

<!--SEI1 11:54 -->

Now if we try to submit again, our new song should be added but with the rest of our playlist state left intact.

Your final `App.js` should look something like this:

```jsx
import './App.css';

import React, { Component } from 'react';

import playlists from './data'

class App extends React.Component {

  state = {
    playlists: playlists,
    title: '',
    artist: '',
    time: '0:00',
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value)
    this.setState({ [event.target.id]: event.target.value })
  }

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const newSong = {
      title: this.state.title,
      artist: this.state.artist,
      time: this.state.time,
    }

    const updatedSongs = [ ...this.state.playlists.songs, newSong ]

    this.setState({
      playlists: {
        ...this.state.playlists,
        songs: updatedSongs
      },
      title: '',
      artist: '',
      time: '0:00',
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h3>{this.state.playlists.title}</h3>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor='artist'>artist</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.artist} id='artist' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor='title'>title</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.title} id='title' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor='time'>time</label>
          <input type='text' value={this.state.time} id='time' onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <input type='submit' />
        </form>
        <div className="playlist">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Artist</th>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Time</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              {
                this.state.playlists.songs.map((song, index) => {
                  return(
                    <tr key={index}>
                      <td>{song.artist}</td>
                      <td>{song.title}</td>
                      <td>{song.time}</td>
                    </tr>
                  )
                })
              }
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

<!--
## Add a New Component

- make sure you are on the same level as `package.json`
- `mkdir src/components`
- `touch src/components/SongList.js`

**src/components/SongList.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class SongList extends Component {
  render () {
    return (<h3> All the Songs</h3>)
  }
}

export default SongList;
```

## Import and render it in our `App.js`

```js
import SongList from './components/SongList.js'
```
Add it below our div with a className of playlists

```js
<div className="playlists">
  <SongList />
``` -->
