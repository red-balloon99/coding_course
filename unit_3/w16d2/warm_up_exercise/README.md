# Project 3 Prep

Getting ready for Project 3 is complicated, because it involves coordinating with all of your group members.  In the next lesson, we will be shooting for a "Hello World" state that allows every member to tackle tasks mostly independently.

Before then, though, we need to make sure we have some things sorted out.

## Team Member Roles

By the end of this lesson, your group should have the following roles settled:

- Lead front-end developer
- Lead back-end developer
- Release engineer
- Product manager

Some team members will have two roles (and feel free to assign additional ones as needed), but **every member must have at least one role**.

## Catching up on HW

If you are near or below the 80% passing line, you need to take the time between now and next lesson to catch up on HW, because once project time starts, we need all members to be contributing fully to the project.

## Authentication

You will need some sort of authentication for Project 3.  We advise one of the team members, and only one of the team members, to work through the authentication section of the previous lesson's Animal Shelter lab.

## Prepping for Approval

We will do group project approvals at the beginning of the next lesson.  We advise one of the team members to create an empty repo for **the backend** with a README that satisfies all the requirements listed in the [Project 3](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-flex/dan-abramov/tree/master/projects/project_3) description.  Make sure this repository is on GitHub, and you add all team members as Contributors to the repo (not sure how to do this?...guessing you know how we're going to answer that question).

We advise another team member (if one is available) to begin work on a Trello.  Make sure you make this board public so other team members can help/view.

## Working on Tonight's HW

Once all these tasks are done, you can use any remaining class time to get an early start on tonight's HW.  Again, once the next lesson is finished, we expect all group members to be 100% dedicated to project work until presentations.
