# Update Form

## Project 3 Update

Since we left the `holidays` update form as a Hungry for More, we want to make sure everyone knows how to make an update from "the React way".

## Set Up

- Get your Project 3 front-end repo up locally
- Checkout a branch called `update` from `master`
- Create an `Update` component
- Make it a `form` with a single text `input` and a single submit `input`
- Make it submit to the backend with a `fetch` POST request
- Make sure it saves to your db

**STOP HERE and commit**

## Update

- Change the `fetch` request to a PUT request
- Make sure the `_id` of your first created item is in the URL for the PUT request
- Make sure you've updated your object successfully

**STOP HERE and commit**

## Getting the Right Object

- Now add a `fetch` that GETs the object you just updated
- Where should this request go? Maybe in a function that runs after a `component` `Mount`ed?
- Fill out the form (use `state`) with the values from this object
- Edit a field, and make sure it saves to the DB

**STOP HERE and commit**

## Adding a Route

- Add a route with a route param of an object ID
- Use this ID to `fetch` an object (i.e. don't hardcode it anymore)
- Create a link in your `Index` component for each of your objects that directs to your `Update` component
