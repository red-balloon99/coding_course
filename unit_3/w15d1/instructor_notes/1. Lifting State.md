# React Lifting Up State

<!--SEI1 4:34 -->

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to lift `state` up from a child component to a parent component

React's data flow is unidirectional and data flows down. That is, data moves from parent components down. A parent component has no idea about the state of its child components.

Let's say we have 3 components for an online store:
- `App`
  - `AllTheThings`
  - `MyShoppingCart`

We want to add products from `AllTheThings` to our shopping cart by clicking on the item.

However, there is no way to move data from one sibling to another. We will have to lift state **up** out of `AllTheThings` into the `App` component and then pass it **down** to `MyShoppingCart`.

## Set Up

- Open the starter code in today's `student_examples/products_app`
- `npm install`
- `npm audit fix --force` (to update to a newer, more secure version of `create-react-app`)
- `npm start`

## Moving Data between Components

First, let's add `state` to the app component

**App.js**

```js
state = {
  products,
  cart: []
}
```

Now, let's add a function that lets us add things to our cart

```js
addToCart = (item) => {
  console.log(item)
  this.setState({cart: [item, ...this.state.cart]})
  console.log(this.state.cart)
}
```

Let's pass this function down into `AllTheThings`

```js
<AllTheThings product={product} key={index} handleAdd={this.addToCart}/>
```

In **AllTheThings.js**, we want to call this function when we click of one of our list items.

We also need to pass in an argument to this function. However, we can't add `()` or the function would fire on page load.

Just like we've done before, we have to wrap `handleAdd` in an anonymous function in order to be able to pass it an argument.

```js
        <li onClick={()=>this.props.handleAdd(this.props.product)}> {this.props.product.name} {this.props.product.price}</li>
```

When we click we should see a log of the item and the cart

**GOTCHA**

Something is wrong in the logs above. Remember that Javascript is asynchronous. Because of that, you'll see that right after we clicked the allen wrench, the cart array is still empty!

Then when we click the next item, the array has one item (the allen wrench we clicked earlier)!

This is because it takes longer for things to update with `setState` than to fire off the console.log. If you want to do something with the `state` after it has been set, we use a callback after the object of properties we are updating:

```js
addToCart = (item) => {
  console.log(item)
  this.setState({cart: [item, ...this.state.cart]}, () => {
    console.log(this.state.cart)
  })
}
```

Next, we'll work on rendering our items in our cart.

First, we pass the `cart` into `MyShoppingCart`:

**App.js**

```js
<MyShoppingCart cart={this.state.cart}/>
```

<!--SEI1 5:20 -->

Then we render our cart list:

**MyShoppingCart.js**

```js
return (
  <div className="MyShoppingCart">
    <h2>Your Cart!</h2>
    <ul>
      {this.props.cart.map((item, index)=> {
        return (
          <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>
        )
      })}
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```

Or the shorter version:

```js
return (
  <div className="MyShoppingCart">
    <h2>Your Cart!</h2>
    <ul>
      {this.props.cart.map((item, index) =>
        <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```

### Challenge

Currently, when you add an item, it adds to the list. However, if you add multiples of the same item, it just adds to the array.

Upgrade this app so that when you have one item it adds to the list. But if you add the same item to your cart it will stay as one item and show a count total to the side of the item.
