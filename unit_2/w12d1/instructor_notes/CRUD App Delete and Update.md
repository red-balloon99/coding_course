## Set Up

Find the fruits app from the last lesson. We will build on top of this during the lesson below.

Don't forget to start your Express server and the Mongo server process.

## Create a Delete Button

In your `index.ejs` file

```html
<li>
    The <a href="/fruits/<%=fruits[i].id; %>"><%=fruits[i].name; %></a> is  <%=fruits[i].color; %>.
    <% if(fruits[i].readyToEat === true){ %>
        It is ready to eat
    <% } else { %>
        It is not ready to eat
    <% } %>
    <!--  ADD DELETE FORM HERE-->
    <form>
        <input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
    </form>
</li>
```

## Create a Delete Route

```javascript
app.delete('/fruits/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.send('deleting...');
});
```

## Have the Delete Button send a DELETE request to the server

<!--We should have covered this two Saturdays ago (without the mongo part) -->

When we click "DELETE" on our index page (`index.ejs`), the form needs to make a DELETE request to our DELETE route.

The problem is that forms can't make DELETE requests.  Only POST and GET.  We can fake this, though.  First we need to install an npm package called `method-override`

```
npm install method-override --save
```

Now, in our `server.js` file, add:

```javascript
//include the method-override package
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
//...
//after app has been defined
//use methodOverride.  We'll be adding a query parameter to our delete form named _method
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

Now go back and set up our delete form to send a DELETE request to the appropriate route

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%=fruits[i].id; %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
```

## Make the Delete Route Delete the Model from MongoDB

Also, have it redirect back to the fruits index page when deletion is complete

```javascript
app.delete('/fruits/:id', (req, res) => {
    Fruit.findByIdAndRemove(req.params.id, (err, data) => {
        res.redirect('/fruits');//redirect back to fruits index
    });
});
```

## Create a link to an edit route

In your `index.ejs` file add the following:

```html
<a href="/fruits/<%=fruits[i].id; %>/edit">Edit</a>
```

## Create an edit route/page

First the route:

```javascript
app.get('/fruits/:id/edit', (req, res) => {
    Fruit.findById(req.params.id, (err, foundFruit) => { //find the fruit
        res.render(
    		'edit.ejs',
    		{
    			fruit: foundFruit //pass in found fruit
    		}
    	);
    });
});
```

Now the EJS:

<!--Remember all that talk about placeholder vs value? We said usually we'd use placeholder...this is one of the biggest exceptions where we set value in an input field.-->

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
        <form>
    		<!--  NOTE: the form is pre-populated with values for the server-->
    		Name: <input type="text" name="name" value="<%=fruit.name%>"/><br/>
    		Color: <input type="text" name="color" value="<%=fruit.color%>"/><br/>
    		Is Ready To Eat:
            <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat"
                <% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
                    checked
                <% } %>
            />
            <br/>
            <input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Changes"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Create an update (PUT) route

```javascript
app.put('/fruits/:id', (req, res) => {
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){
        req.body.readyToEat = true;
    } else {
        req.body.readyToEat = false;
    }
    res.send(req.body);
});
```

## Have the edit page send a PUT request

In the `edit.ejs`

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%=fruit.id%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
```

<!--Note that we don't need to add anything extra to method override, since it's still using the same _method field.-->

## Make the PUT Route Update the Model in MongoDB

```javascript
app.put('/fruits/:id', (req, res)=>{
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){
        req.body.readyToEat = true;
    } else {
        req.body.readyToEat = false;
    }
    Fruit.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, {new:true}, (err, updatedModel)=>{
        res.send(updatedModel);
    });
});
```

## Make the PUT Route Redirect Back to the Index Page

```javascript
Fruit.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, (err, updatedModel)=>{
    res.redirect('/fruits');
});
```
