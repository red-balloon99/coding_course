# Big O Notation

## Overview
This lesson covers the basics of Big O Notation.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=e0b2701a-8c98-43b3-984c-14b71a9a5492)
2. In class exercise: [Analyzing Algorithms](./exercises/BigOExercise.md)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain how Big O Notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.
