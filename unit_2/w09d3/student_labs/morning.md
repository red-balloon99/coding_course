# Lab - REST: Index/Show

## Superheros

### Basic Express App
1. create a new directory inside your labs dir called "superheroes"
1. cd into `superheroes`
1. create a `server.js` file
1. perform an `npm init`, specify `server.js` as your entry
1. install `express`
1. inside `server.js`, require express and save it to a variable named `express`
1. create a variable named `app`, and set it equal to `express()`
1. have `app` listen on port 3000
    - once it's listening, log "Here to save the day..."
1. test it by going to http://localhost:3000

### Routes

1. Create a variable called superheroes and set it to `[ 'Superman', 'Wonder Woman', 'Black Panther' ]`
1. Create a route to `/superheroes`, which will be the `index`
    - The route should send the entire superheroes array
1. Create a route to `/superheroes/:index`, which will be the `show` route
    - The route should send the superhero that is at the index in the superheroes array as specified by `req.params.index`

### Enhancing Data

1. Change the entries in the superheroes array so that each element in the array is an object
    - E.g. Instead of 'superman' have: `{ name: "Superman", powers: ['flight', 'invulnerability', 'x-ray vision']}`
1. Upgrade your `res.send` on the `show` route to send the superhero name as an `h1` and then the powers as `li` items in an `ul` ( hint: use string interpolation or string concatenation )
1. Writing HTML this way is really tedious and hard to read...I wonder if we'll learn a better way to do this soon?

### Add Villians!

1. Bring in this data and save it to a `villains` variable

```js
[
    {
     name: "Lex Luthor",
     powers: ["super brain"]
    },
    {
     name: "Ares",
     powers: ["shape shifting", "teleporting"]
     },
     {
      name: "Killmonger",
      powers: ["ability to fit in Black Panther's suit", "internet agreement that he looks badass"]
     }
]
```

1. Create an index route for `villains` below our `heroes` index route
1. Create show routes for these `villains`, that have the powers listed (just like superheroes)
1. On the show page for a superhero, show the matching `villain`'s name (hint: the `villains` array index position matches the hero)

Hints:
- It's all just JavaScript! Do JS things to manipulate the 'data'

## Friends

1. cd back into the labs directory
1. create a directory called `friends`
1. cd into `friends`
1. Create a basic express app
1. Create a variable inside `server.js` that is an array of your friends
1. Create `index` and `show` routes
1. Enhance the data so that each friend is an object with `age`, `location`, `eyeColor`, and `hairColor` attributes
1. The `index` should be a list of names that link to the show page
1. the `show` route should show all the details of your friend
