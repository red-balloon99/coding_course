# Lab - MVC: Index

1. Extend the app we've built in class so that the index route uses EJS to render all the fruits into HTML
    - Each fruit that is displayed should have a link to that fruit's show page
    - Each fruit's show page should have a link back to the index page
1. Open up [this starter code](afternoon/server.js) and follow the directions in the comments.

Work on X-Files or the Rat-to-Restaurant SUPER_BONUS for today.

**And/Or**

We're sending HTML to our browser, but how do we send and link CSS?

Research and try to implement it!
