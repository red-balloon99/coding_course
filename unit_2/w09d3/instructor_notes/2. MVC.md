# MVC

<!--SEI1 12:01 -->

## Lesson Objectives

1. Define MVC and explain why it matters
1. Move our data into a separate file
1. Move our presentation code into an EJS file

## Define MVC and explain why it matters

- One of the core tenants of good programming is to compartmentalize your code
- Already our code is getting a little messy
    - we have data, app instantiation (listening), and routes all in one file
- One way to keep an app from getting messy is to separate it out into three sections
    - Models
        - data (javascript variables)
    - Views
        - how the data is displayed to the user (HTML)
    - Controllers
        - the glue that connects the models with the views
- This allows various developers to divide up a large code base
    - minimizes likelihood of developers overwriting each others code
    - allows developers to specialize
        - one can focus just on getting good at dealing with data
        - one can focus just on getting good at HTML
        - one can focus just on getting good at connecting the two
- Think of MVC as a restaurant
    - Models are the cook
        - prepares food/data
    - Views are what the customer eats
        - consumes food/data
    - Controllers are the waiter
        - brings food from cook to customer
        - has no idea how food/data is prepared
        - has no idea how the food/data is consumed

## Move our data into a separate file

1. Create a directory called `models` inside our app directory
1. Inside `/models`, create your data file (`fruits.js`)
1. Put your `fruits` variable in there

    ```javascript
    const fruits = [
        {
            name:'apple',
            color: 'red',
            readyToEat: true
        },
        {
            name:'pear',
            color: 'green',
            readyToEat: false
        },
        {
            name:'banana',
            color: 'yellow',
            readyToEat: true
        }
    ];    
    ```

1. Now, require that file in the original `server.js`

    ```javascript
    const fruits = require('./models/fruits.js'); //NOTE: it must start with ./ if it's just a file, not an NPM package
    ```

1. But, we could have multiple variables in our `/models/fruits.js` file.
    - How does javascript know which variable in `/models/fruits.js` to assign to the fruits const in `server.js` (the result of the `require()` statment)?
    - We must tell javascript which variable we want to be the result of the `require()` statement in `server.js`

        ```javascript
        //at the bottom of /models/fruits.js
        module.exports = fruits;
        ```

## Move our presentation code into an EJS file

Now we want to move our View code (HTML) into a separate file just like we did with the data

1. Install the NPM package EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
    - this is a templating library that allows us to mix data into our html
    - the HTML will change based on the data!
    - `npm install ejs --save`
1. Create a `views` directory inside our app directory
1. Inside `/views`, create a file called `show.ejs`
    - this will be the html for our show route
1. Put some html into `show.ejs`

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Fruits show page</h1>
        </body>
    </html>    
    ```

1. Now, instead of `res.send('some text')`, we can call `res.render('show.ejs')`
    - `express` looks inside the `/views` directory by default, so we can type just `'show.ejs'`
    - it will send the HTML in the `show.ejs` file as a response

        ```javascript
        app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
            res.render('show.ejs');
        });        
        ```

<!--SEI1 12:28 -->

Now, let's mix our data into our HTML

1. Our route callback is acting like the controller now.  Let's gather the data and pass it to the view

    ```javascript
    app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
        res.render('show.ejs', { //second param must be an object
            fruit: fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray] //there will be a variable available inside the ejs file called fruit, its value is fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray]
        });
    });    
    ```

1. Access the data in the view:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Fruits show page</h1>
            The <%=fruit.name; %> is  <%=fruit.color; %>.
            <% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
                It is ready to eat
            <% } else { %>
                It is not ready to eat
            <% } %>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Note that there are two main types of EJS tags
    - `<% %>` run some javascript
    - `<%= %>` run some javascript and insert the result of the javascript into the HTML
